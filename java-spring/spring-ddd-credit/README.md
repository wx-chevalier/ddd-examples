    - a message broker (RabbitMQ)
    - HTTP Feeds
    - Spring Application Events

## Which Spring Technologies are being used?

The project uses the following Spring technologies:

- Spring Framework Core
- Spring MVC

## Prerequisites and getting started

In order to run the application you need to have Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.

When you have docker up and running you need to perform the following steps on the command line:

1. ./mvnw clean package
2. docker-compose up --build
3. After everything has started you can open http://localhost:9000 in a browser of your choice
